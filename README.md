# DrivingEnvelopeProtection
Implementation of the driving envelope protection algorithm in Simulink with testing environment in IPG Carmaker.

This is a source code of our implementation of the driving envelope protection scheme, described in a paper, which is under review process. Driving envelope protection is implemented in the core as a model predictive controller. As a solver for the optimal control problem, we used Gurobi version 9.1.0. As an Implementation environment, we used Matlab/Simulink R2021a. As a test environment, we used IPG CarMaker 10.1.

This project also contains the setting of the used car and test environments in CarMaker. We added a technical paper with a short description of provided ride tests. Video results of the experiments are published on our YouTube channel.
